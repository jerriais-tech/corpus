<P>Although much derided over the centuries, this is a perfectly respectable statue of George II, and reminiscent of the two statues of the king in London: by John Michael Ruysbrack at Greenwich (1735), and by John Nost the elder in Golden Square, Soho (erected 1753, actually made 33 years earlier for Duke of Chandos; lead painted white). Both statues depict the king in Roman dress.</P>

<P>At the head of the Market Place, upon a pedestal, stands a gilded Statue intended to represent George the Second - the attitude of which is so graceless, and the countenance so unlike, that it has been found necessary to inscribe upon the stone, the name of the personage it was meant to exhibit. The fact is - the States of the Island were duped by an old gentleman of the name of Gosset, who wanting a piece of ground to render a house he was building more commodious - offered, for the grant of it, a Statue of His Majesty to adorn the publick Square. The proposal was accepted &amp; the figure was brought over from England. The site had been previously prepared, and iron rails placed round, to keep off the rude hands of curiosity. A day was fixed for displaying to the Inhabitants the brazen image of their Monarch - it was conveyed to its eminent station under the inscrutable cover of a Blanket - the publick eye became eager to behold the Royal Effigy - the signal was given &amp; the Veil withdrawn - when instead of the British King - Jersey had conspicuously placed in its capital - the Statue of a Roman Emperor.</P>

<P>Mr. Gosset - the patriotic Donor conceiving that his countrymen might be easily duped, and he perform, at a cheap rate, his part of the contract, purchased this old figure of Julius Caesar at a Sale, for its weight in Lead, and added to its ancient dress the decoration of the Garter - as a sure insignium of the expected Monarch - and a certain proof against discovery; but a lady who had recently returned from Rome, visiting the island soon after the erection of this valuable treasure, recognised, to the great mortification of the Natives, the &quot;very stamp and image&quot; of her old friend in the Capitol.</P>

<P>Nous voyons avec plaisir que l’on occupe en ce moment des pr&eacute;paratifs n&eacute;cessaires pour dorer la statue de la Place-Royale, et pour r&eacute;cr&eacute;pir ou repiquer les pierres du pi&eacute;destal. On nous assure que cette double op&eacute;ration doit co&ucirc;ter 15 liv. st., qui seront pay&eacute;es au moyen de souscriptions volontaires. Comme il est beaucoup de personnes qui ne connaissent pas l’&eacute;poque o&ugrave; cette statue fut &eacute;rig&eacute;e, nous avons pens&eacute; que l’acte des &Eacute;tats qui a rapport &agrave; ce sujet ne sera pas lu sans quelque int&eacute;r&ecirc;t:</P>

The year 1751 saw a change in the Market Place. On July 9th of that year the present statue of George II was unveiled. It stands in all probability on the very spot where once stood the Market Cross, which as we have seen was the place where all public proclamations were made and where the Laws of the States and Ordinances of the Court were promulgated. What became of this interesting relic of antiquity and when it actually disappeared must remain for the present uncertain. We know that the Market Place was paved with stones in 1668. It is possible the Market Cross may have been pulled down at this date whilst the work was being done. An Act of the States of thirty years later dated March 22nd 1697-8, already cited as ordering the removal of "La Cage," refers to the erection in the Market Place of a pedestal which was to support a dial. It was to be fixed on a spot in front of the house of Clement Chevalier, the property formerly occupied by the Chronique Newspaper, and the Act of the States informs us that it was to be an ornament to the Market-Place. There is no indication in the Rolls that this pedestal and dial were to replace the old Market Cross, and whether the pedestal was ever erected must remain doubtful, for 23 years later on the 21st December 1720, we find the States entering into an agreement with a certain Edouard Le Preveu to erect in the Market Place at such spot as would be found most convenient for the public use a column or pillar with pedestal of the Tuscan type, "Une colonne avec un piedestal de l'ordre Toscan." The column was to support a globe. That this column was never erected is quite certain for on November 7th 1748, we find the States deciding to sue Daniel Le Preveu, a son of Edouard Le Preveu, to execute the agreement which his father had entered into with them. Daniel Le Preveu thereupon was permitted to resign his agreement in favour of one Abraham Gosset, who undertook to carry out its provisions. A couple of years later on 2nd June 1750, Gosset was present at a meeting of the States and suggested that instead of constructing a Pyramid in the Market Place, he be permitted to erect a statue of H.M. King George II, the Statue to be of lead and to be gilded, whilst the pedestal was to be encircled by an iron railing, " balustrade," which was also to be gilded. The States agreed, and on July 9th 1751, the Statue was unveiled in the presence of the Lieutenant-Governor, the Militia and a large concourse of the inhabitants. The Deputy-Viscount proclaimed the Statue to be erected in honour of H.M. King George II. The people then gave three cheers and at a signal given from the Church Tower the guns of Elizabeth Castle fired a Royal Salute, answered by a feu-de-joie , from the Militia in the Market Place. Then were brought on the scene many bottles of wine and the King's health was drunk by all the Company present. In the evening there was a general illumination of the Town.<p>
