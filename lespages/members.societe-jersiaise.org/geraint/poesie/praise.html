<br>
I've travelled East, I've travelled West, <br>
North and South; and by God's mercy <br>
I live to say, I never found, <br>
Within the wide terrestrial bound, <br>
Such a sweet&#173;bosomed human nest, <br>
As this dear little, green little Isle of Jersey. <br>
Look around; and nicely scan it, <br>
Fenced about with prickly granite, <br>
Like a hedgehog's back, that never a foe <br>
On Jersey ground can plant his toe, <br>
Without a bleeding in his nail: <br>
And if ever the Frenchman crossed the wave,<br>
To pounce on this loyal Isle of Jersey, <br>
He didn't wait long to turn his tail, <br>
When Peirson drew the patriot glaive, <br>
And made him pray to Heaven for mercy. <br>
In Jersey Isle the palmy kail <br>
Grows ten feet high, with such a stock, <br>
As hard as oak, and strong to knock <br>
The devil down, and all his folk, <br>
If he should dare to shew his face <br>
Within St. Helier's cirque of grace. <br>
And who is he of mortal men, <br>
That hath not known with wondering ken, <br>
How Jersey grows, to recreate us <br>
At dinner, such superb potatoes; <br>
And how all London in the season, <br>
And Queen Victoria, with good reason, <br>
Can't dine without our prime potatoes. <br>
And then such cows - the Jersey cows, <br>
Which every farming wit allows <br>
To stand, in public estimation, <br>
The ladies of the cow creation; <br>
So smooth and sleek, so neat and trim, <br>
With such a slender, shapely limb, <br>
And such fine head, and large full eye, <br>
When on soft grass you see her lie <br>
So placid, motherly, and mild, <br>
She courts the touch of any child.<br>
'Tis quite well known, I can avow,<br>
For such a model Jersey cow,<br>
An American came across the Atlantic,<br>
And, when the sea with storm was frantic,<br>
Carried it home to his Western bounds,<br>
Leaving behind him a thousand pounds.<br>
And for our potatoe-growth sublime,<br>
I should have told you at the time,<br>
For our potatoes we pocket nearly<br>
Half a million of sovereigns yearly.<br>
Kings in court and monks in cloister<br>
For good living had a sharp eye;<br>
But there's nothing on earth like a Jersey oyster,<br>
When the stomach is flat and the throat is dry.<br>
And if you want a sugared sweet,<br>
Honey from Hybla will not beat<br>
A Jersey Parsnip:- What big wig,<br>
Mayor or master, provost, warden,<br>
Would wish to nibble a nicer fig<br>
Than that which grows in a Jersey garden?<br>
Nor strange ; for with soft sloping grace<br>
Our land looks in the Sun's bright face;<br>
And, though rich loamy meads we lack,<br>
We fatten our roods with strong sea, wrack.<br>
And who has not heard of Jersey Toads?<br>
Which in the field, and by the roads<br>
Creep forth from leafy green abodes,<br>
And by an instinct all divine,<br>
Which well instructs them how to dine,<br>
They keep the soil of Jersey clean<br>
From greedy grub, and slug obscene.<br>
As in the land of sacred Nile,<br>
With reverence deep and holy awe,<br>
And rites of sacerdotal law,<br>
Dark men that stirred the teeming soil,<br>
Gave honour to the crocodile,<br>
For that he lay on slimy flats,<br>
And cleared the sacred flood from rats;<br>
And built for him a dainty shrine,<br>
With pool of water pure and fine,<br>
And cushion soft, where he might lay<br>
His scaly frame at hot mid-day:<br>
So Jerseymen in field and road<br>
Pay grateful honour to the toad;<br>
And every Jersey heart cloth know<br>
Fine-tingling joy, when he may hear<br>
The friendly greeting in his ear,<br>
<I>Comment crapaud! - C'est bon crapaud!<br>
</I>And, if a Jersey man doth know<br>
Strange twitches in his thumb or too,<br>
Or in his body feel a schism<br>
From dyspepsy or rheumatism,<br>
He straightway to the toad doth go,<br>
And makes its old grey poll to flow<br>
With chrism of holy oil, and, lo!<br>
Dislodged the baleful pain doth go<br>
From twitching thumb and twinging toe.<br>
And now I've told you in good style<br>
The praises of this blissful isle ;<br>
And if there be a sore-vexed wight<br>
By Dee or Don, Medway or Mersey,<br>
Who shuts no eye the long drear night,<br>
With poisoned blood from air mephitic,<br>
Fretful nerve, or cough bronchitic,<br>
Lot him pack up, and find God's mercy<br>
In this green paradise of Jersey.<br>
In this fair land, where frost and snow<br>
Just touch the smiling roods, and go;<br>
Where Winter, shorn of surly gloom,<br>
Wreathes his grey hair with purple bloom;<br>
Where no unequal law hath skill<br>
To starve the many, and fatten the few;<br>
Nor dares a dead man's monstered will<br>
To cheat the living of their due ;<br>
But where the arm that tills the soil,<br>
Reaps the fair profit of his toil ;<br>
Nor frets to find his labour spent<br>
To feed a fool, or swell a rent.<br>
'Tis but one step, I tell you true,<br>
To Southampton from Waterloo;<br>
Another step to Guernsey; and,<br>
With a third tiny step, you land<br>
On Jersey pier: Here take your stand,<br>
And learn to breathe unpoisoned air,<br>
And look up to unclouded skies,<br>
And feed on dainties rich and rare,<br>
On lobster p&acirc;t&eacute;s and crab pies,<br>
Guernsey crabs of Titan size;<br>
And creamy soup, distilled superb<br>
From Conger Eel and dainty herb:<br>
And you will grow both fat and fair,<br>
With ruddy cheeks and shining hair,<br>
Serene, and sweet, and debonnair<br>
In this dear little, green little Isle of Jersey,<br>
Where I am now by sovran mercy,<br>
To sing its praises free from pain,<br>
And full of happy thoughts. Amen!<br>
