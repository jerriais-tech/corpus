This is to live, to make the most of time;<br>
A thousand flowers bloom beneath our feet,<br>
A thousand birds are singing music sweet,<br>
A thousand bells above us ring their chime; <br>
All things subserve in harmony sublime <br>
The good of man, and shall he then refuse? <br>
'Twere sin indeed! the rather let him use <br>
But not abuse, for this would lead to crime. <br>
'Tis not to live to seek a hermit's cell, <br>
And there o'er this world's evil idly brood; <br>
To make man happy we with him must dwell, <br>
The world's arena is the sphere for good. <br>
Why should we then God's blessings e'er despise? <br>
Who thankfully receive alone are truly wise.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<br>
Earth hath its flowers and Heaven hath its stars: <br>
How great, Thy gift of beauty to us, Lord, <br>
Which everywhere fair nature's scenes afford. <br>
The world is beautiful: 'tis sin that mars <br>
Thy handiwork; the fall hath left its scars <br>
Upon the lovely features of our sphere.<br>
O, truly, sin hath made great havoc here <br>
With its most dismal train of crime and wars! <br>
And man were ever happy but for this <br>
Dark blight of evil that impairs his bliss, <br>
Driving out peace, the meek-eyed turtle-dove, <br>
Making him wretched, causing him to miss <br>
Thro' his own recklessness and lack of love, <br>
The priceless blessings showered from above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;<p>

<br>
Oh! I have loved thee, and do love thee still: <br>
My love but grows the stronger as time goes, <br>
Getting new life, as does the gentle rill <br>
From every slope as its pure course it flows; <br>
Or as the bees which honey sweet distil, <br>
Sipping fresh nectar from each fragrant rose; <br>
All my heart's pleasure is to do thy will, <br>
And far from thee it knoweth no repose. <br>
Thy love for me is lasting too as mine: <br>
I see it in thine eyes, I breathe it in thy kiss, <br>
And on thy brow, fond love, I see it shine; <br>
Thou knowest not how much I value this <br>
Affection sweet and dearest love of thine. <br>
True love, requited love, 'tis more than bliss.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;<p>

It was so dark and threatening, an angry cloud <br>
That flashed bright lightning in the distant sky, <br>
Portent of coming storm and tempest nigh, <br>
Which soon would wrap up earth in dismal shroud: <br>
Such was the sorrow that my poor heart cowed, <br>
Till faith within my soul had cast her light, <br>
Chasing the clouds away and making bright <br>
Where for a season idle fears did crowd. <br>
'Tis thus in life, we apprehend and fear, <br>
Forgetful that we have a Father near <br>
Who giveth joy and sorrow both for good; <br>
'Tis thus our happiness is oft destroyed, <br>
We suffer often what we might avoid, <br>
If by us rightly God were understood.<br>

&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;<p>


Father above, our griefs are known to Thee,<br>
For naught to Thee is hidden, naught concealed<br>
Past, present, future, are to Thee revealed;<br>
Thou knowest all that was, is, and shall be;<br>
Thou canst into the heart's recesses see<br>
The pent-up anguish, and the half-hushed sigh,<br>
The tear that falls unnoticed from the eye:<br>
The silent language of adversity.<br>
Why should we fear? is not the promise sure?<br>
Thou, Lord, canst help Thy children to endure;<br>
From all their troubles Thou canst set them free.<br>
O help us to resign! may good or ill<br>
Be given according to Thy holy will:<br>
We fear not, Father, for we trust in Thee.<br>

&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;<p>

Reader, farewell! the writer of these lays<br>
To thee this little book doth dedicate;<br>
In them is neither lore nor wisdom great,<br>
Nor aught indeed deserving of much praise;<br>
Some are the offspring of his happy days,<br>
Others of sorrow, for is not life arrayed: <br>
Of smiles and tears, of mingled sun and shade;<br>
Man treads his daily path in various ways.<br>
Should any of these tentatives e'er be<br>
A means to soothe thy woes or gladden thee,<br>
His work will not be fruitless and in vain:<br>
Reward sufficient will it be indeed,<br>
If useful fruitage crown the lowly seed,<br>
And he delight thee with his humble strain. <br>

Besides being well-known as a poet in J&egrave;rriais, AA Le Gros also wrote in French and English - although it would not be unfair to say that his verse in English is not as interesting. These sonnets come from a book of "Poems" published in England.<p>
