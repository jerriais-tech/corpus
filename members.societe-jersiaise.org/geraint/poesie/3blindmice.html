Three blind Govenours,<br>
(Nicholas, Ray, and Stewart,)<br>
&quot;See how they run, see how they run&quot; <br>
Before the battle's fought, before the battle's won, <br>
Nw, come and see the fun. <br>
<I>They say</I>; &#147;the question now is settled,&quot;<br>
&#147;Before I came, if not before,&quot;<br>
<I>I say</I>; fiddle, fiddle, the cats will fiddle,<br>
.And the mice will <I>run</I> before.<br>
<br>
One<I> blind </I>and magnanimous Bailiff,<br>
He is a cad, also a caitiff. <br>
See how he runs, see how he runs <br>
To outrun the other ones, <br>
To be a Jersey Bailiff. <br>
Who'd be a Jersey Bailiff ? <br>
&#147;May the Lord have mercy,&quot; <br>
&#147;On the Bailiff of Jersey.&quot; <br>
<I>He says </I>; bless me I see that you've been &#147;badly treated,&quot; <br>
But, you're not the only man whom I have cheated. <br>
<I>I say</I> ; fiddle,. fiddle, the cats may fiddle, <br>
Mice not blind, won't dance to the Bailiff`s fiddle.<br>
<br>
Twelve <I>blind </I>but honest Ju-Rats<br>
Twelve <I>honest </I>men as I'm alive,<br>
They calculate that two and two 'makes' five, <br>
&quot;See how they run, see how they run&quot; <br>
Now come and see the fun. <br>
These sit upon a rotten Bench, <br>
Sometimes they preach, and say &quot; Retrench.&quot;<br>
They agitate, and cogitate, and legislate<br>
And sometimes they <I>do</I> Administrate. <br>
<I>They say</I> ; we are omnipotent and mighty, <br>
Nobody can't tell us nothing <br>
In our red gowns we look most sightly, <br>
We are all most, if not quite all mighty. <br>
<I>I say</I> ; fiddle, fiddle, the cats <I>may</I> fiddle, <br>
Three of you have gone to the dogs. <br>
And the rest will go to the Devil.<br>
<br>
TWELVE <I>blind </I>and ridiculous Rectors,<br>
Can any such be found ? <br>
Who pray for our salvation, <br>
To save us from damnation <br>
While the world goes round and round. <br>
See how they run, see how they run <br>
Now come  and see <br>
They try to build a landing stage, <br>
They tell us, &#147;all the world's a stage,&#148; <br>
While the world goes round and round. <br>
One is a canon ecclesiastical, <br>
And one 'originaire' Bombastical. <br>
They forsake their fellow sinners <br>
To attend committee dinners. <br>
<I>They say</I>; there are no States to-day, <br>
So come, and let us pray. <br>
<I>I say</I>; fiddle, fiddle, the cats <I>will</I> fiddle, <br>
While the mice go <I>praying</I> round.<br>
<br>
TWELVE <I>blind </I>but courteous Constables,<br>
Twelve 'Cincinnati' here you see.<br>
&#147;See how they run, see how they run,&quot;<br>
Now, come and see the fun.<br>
With wooden heads, and turnip heads,<br>
They fight and strive to be M.P. <br>
They prate, and vote, and vote by rote, <br>
And throw our money in the sea: <br>
Their engineering skill is what we most admire <br>
<I>They say; </I>Our Engineer's turned out a &quot; liah&#148;<br>
&#147;For the sea don't come no higher&#148;<br>
<I>I say</I> ; fiddle, fiddle, the cats will fiddle, <br>
While the mice go <I>building </I>round.<br>
<br>
Fourteen <I>blind </I>and foolish Deputies,<br>
These are <I>the elect, </I>elected by vox populi,<br>
<I>The</I>y <I>say</I>; the ballot's all 'my eye.'<br>
&#147;See how they run, see how they run&#148; <br>
Now, come and see the fun. <br>
<I>They say; </I>we represent the people, and we vote, <br>
As Constables and Parsons vote.' <br>
We vote for dredging and for Kinniple<br>
To spend the public money not a little. <br>
We vote for more Deputies for Town, <br>
Because the country sits upon the Town.<br>
We vote for a landing stage of stone,<br>
Because it would not do of wood alone.<br>
We vote for concrete blocks, blocks of cement<br>
To please our Judge Briard ; <I>he sells cement<B>.<br>
</I>W</B>e vote for building on dry ground,<br>
And then to bring the water in,<br>
To build where water is, we've always found<br>
Besides expense, would be an awful sin.<br>
We vote for 'our privileges' and for our 'Constitution'<br>
For our Norman laws, and for our 'Institution.'<br>
We vote for 'Ome Rule,' for our own Mis. Government,<br>
We've no confidence in Treasury, nor yet in Parliament.<br>
We vote <I>against Imperial</I> Interference,<br>
We call it just impertinence.<br>
We vote for our Royal Bailiff,<br>
Because he's king of all supreme,<br>
And he's the 'cream of all the cream.' <br>
We don't want &quot;no &quot; Reform nor Progress yet, <br>
We vote for Statesmen who the <I>pickings</I> get. <br>
We vote for anything and everything, <br>
To keep things just as they are; <br>
We<I> </I>vote, and stick to any mortal thing, <br>
We want no change ; leave things just as they are. <br>
<I>I say </I>; fiddle, fiddle, the cats will riddle, <br>
And they will also play. &quot;But nobody won't listen,&quot; <br>
To what other people say;<br>
&#147;Sh'est assez pour en faire rire les kaats.&#148;<br>
<br>
<br>
<CENTER>Conclusion And Chorus<br>
Sung by All &quot;Thorough Bred&quot; Jerseymen,<br>
</CENTER><br>
Now let us sing, long live our king,<br>
Our Royal George, and long live he;<br>
Long may he live to be the King,<br>
Of this Island <I>of the</I> <I>sea.<br>
</I>Old Englands Queen is not <I>our</I> Queen,<br>
Although she's Empress of Indee,<br>
She's only George's Suzeraine, <br>
And <I>only </I>&quot; Duchesse de la Normandie,&quot; <br>
When we kept Her Majesty's Jubilee,<br>
Sir George, <I>he</I> ran away you see, <br>
<I>Only</I> to show his Loyaltee. <br>
When we celebrate <I>his</I> Jubilee, <br>
May we all be there to see.<br>
<br>
<I>I say</I> ; Down with all Traitors and <br>
God Save the Queen.<br>
<br>
