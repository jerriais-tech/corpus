The Lord of St. Ouen's was down by the lake,<br>
When the sun through the mists was beginning to break,<br>
By its margin he sought, as he trod the soft ground,<br>
The Carp to ensnare as they sported around,<br>
From the depths of its waters, so calm that the air<br>
Scarcely rippled the surface, a mirror so fair.<br>
The day is too chill, mists are floating on high,<br>
Drawn from out the dark earth to obscure the bright sky,<br>
Ah ! who are those creeping beneath that high mound<br>
Of glittering sand, with a silence profound ?<br>
Ah, Lord of St. Ouen's, I bid thee beware,<br>
And fly from a deep and a treacherous snare;<br>
The foe will surround thee, thy blood on their steel<br>
Will bedew the cold ground - is there nought to reveal<br>
The danger that threatens ? His steed loudly neighs,<br>
As corslet and faulchion gleam bright in the rays<br>
Of the sun, which now breaks thro' the mist and the gloom<br>
That may light with its beams on De Carteret's tomb.<br>
Mount thy steed, and away ! Now he's off with a bound,<br>
From the foes who had sought Ouen's Lord to surround.<br>
There's a race for a death, there's a race for a life,<br>
Will the steel drink his breath in the mad'ning strife ?<br>
He's away to the hills - they are closely behind;<br>
He ascends the steep bank, but new dangers to find,<br>
On its brow there are foes to cut off his retreat :<br>
He bears himself bravely, his steed's strong and fleet.<br>
To the vale of the Charri&egrave;re he turns him aside,&#173;<br>
Oh ! on ! the foes follow, their steeds deeply dyed<br>
With blood on their flanks, as they're goaded along,<br>
He'll be slain, though his horse is so fleet and so strong.<br>
Too closely they follow, - he'll ne'er reach the vale !<br>
Of his death to his friends who will bear the sad tale?<br>
Deep banks line the road, two and twenty feet wide&#173;<br>
He is lost or across the deep chasm must ride.<br>
Now aid him brave steed, though thy heart may be broke,<br>
Save thy lord in his need from the faulchion's stroke.<br>
One spring! he bounds over! - alas he is lost;<br>
No! his steed gains his footing - in safety he's crossed<br>
Now hie thee, brave horse, o'er the long sandy plain<br>
On his castle De Carteret looks once again,<br>
Ere he reaches its portal the gallant steed falls,<br>
Yields his breath for his Lord, who is safe by his walls.<p>
