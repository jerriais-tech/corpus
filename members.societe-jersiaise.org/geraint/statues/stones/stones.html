&nbsp;<p>

As part of Jersey's Millennium celebrations, each Parish was to erect a Millennium cross and a Millennium stone. The stones were initiated by La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Jersiaise as a sort of modern megalithic network. The crosses mark 2000 years of Christianity and recall the wayside crosses lost at the Reformation.<p>

These pages record the crosses and stones in each Parish.<p>

New millennium to be marked by standing stones in each parish<p>

 Giant 'fingers pointing to the future' in the form of granite standing stones are to be erected in every parish and linked by pathways to mark the millennium.<p>

 The plan, drawn up by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Jersiaise - and first suggested by executive committee member Philip Le Brocq - has won enthusiastic support from the Constables.<p>

 The project has also been greeted positively by Ronez Quarries, who will be donating and supplying the massive granite stones which will be between nine and 12 feet high.<p>

 Further support has come from the Jersey Field Squadron who have agreed to deliver each standing stone to the 12 sites and help to set them up.<p>

 In November, Mr Le Brocq and Soci&eacute;t&eacute; executive officer Pauline Syvret gave a presentation about the project to the Committee of Constables whose reaction was very favourable.<p>

 Mrs Syvret contacted Ronez Ltd and said that she was equally delighted with the reception which they gave the scheme by offering to donate each giant stone which will be kept in its natural state once selected.<p>

 Each parish is to be given &pound;500 from an anonymous bequest to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute;.<p>

 It is planned that alongside each standing stone a plaque will be sited to explain the reason for the presence o fthe granite, acknowledge the donors involved and give information about the nearest route to the next parish stone. Mr Le Brocq said that the advantage of this millennium project was that it enabled all of the parishes to take part on an equal basis and the stones would last long after most of the other ideas to mark this occasion were gone.<p>

 'The standing stones will be giant fingers pointing to the future and inspiring people to wonder what that future holds for them,' he said.<p>

 One of the main aims of the scheme, he said, would be to link the parish stones with a series of pathways where pedestrians could walk safely and peacefully.<p>

 Such a network of walks would benefit the Tourism industry as an added attraction, he said.<p>

 Mrs Syvret described the project as having the potential to be a true community venture and said that consideration was being given to inviting schoolchildren to see the final process of raising the stones.<p>

 The Soci&eacute;t&eacute;'s project will be in addition to and separate from a possible project to provide parish crosses for the millennium.<p>

 Its organisers see it as an expression - for Christians and non-Christians - of general thanksgiving and celebration of Jersey's special features.<p>

<B>Millennium wayside crosses</B> <p>

 The design of the 12 proposed Millennium wayside crosses has been approved by Planning and Environment and is now taking shape. <p>

 The 12 crosses are being erected in each of the Island's parishes as a gift from the States. The project is one of those sponsored by the Millennium Fund to mark 2,000 years of Christianity. <p>

 Planning president Senator Nigel Qu&eacute;r&eacute;e said: 'These structures require development permission under the Planning Law. As they will be in place for a very long time and will be prominent public structures, the committee felt it was important to secure a design that was appropriate and one which had an established local basis. Working closely with the Constables Committee, I believe that we have achieved this.' <p>

 The States approved the principle of presenting the 12 crosses early last year. It is believed that wayside crosses were once abundant throughout the Island, until they were all but destroyed during the Reformation. Little evidence now remains of them. <p>

 The design selected is based on the cross which now stands at Elizabeth Castle, which was erected there in 1959 to mark the site of the Abbey of St Helier. It is believed to be an excellent reproduction of a medieval wayside cross. <p>

 The proposed design, which features a slender granite cross atop a solid granite base, including an octagonal supporting collar, will be around 8-ft high. The inscription of the date and the appropriate parish crest on the base of the crosses is at the discretion of the individual parishes. <p>

<B>Crossing a Christian threshold</B><p>

Stone dresser Michael Frost puts the final touches to one of the 12 Millennium wayside crosses which are being erected in each parish as a gift from the States. The project is one of those sponsored by the Millennium Fund to mark 2,000 years of Christianity. Each of the grey granite crosses costs about &pound;1,000 and took Mr Frost about a week to craft.<p>

<b>Take a closer look at the individuality of theMillennium Standing Stones</b><p>

 Far from being absurd, as John Marshall claims, the Millennium Standing Stones have just those qualities he wants from them. They 'allow the visitor the opportunity to stretch the imagination and construct in the mind's eye what might have been'.<p>

 They have marker stones with a bronze map of Jersey explaining what they are and where their eleven fellow stones can be found. Yet they also encourage the onlooker to leap 4,000 years into the past and link up with those who erected similar stones at Blanches Banques, St Ouen and at St Clement. They remind us of the Jerseyman's rock-like independence, his durability and his integrity, they change shape, texture, colour and character at different times of the day and each typifies that separateness and yet sense of co-operation which identifies each parish and its honorary system.<p>

 Each Parish Assembly selected its stone from those skilfully quarried and as generously donated by Ronez Quarries. Each was equally skilfully transported and erected by the Jersey Militia to beautifully sited vantage points - again the product of parish selection. The marker stones and their explanatory bronze plaques were sponsored by Romerils and the whole project has been spearheaded by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Jersiaise. It is proud to have been associated with such a special, and stimulating project to mark our links with those who lived in Jersey 4,000 years ago. They show how deeply we are rooted in our past and yet are fingers pointing to our future.<p>

 The 12 crosses donated by the States of Jersey have fulfilled the desire to celebrate 2,000 years of Christianity. The 12 stones complement them by recording our debt to those who erected their symbols 2,000 years before as a sign of their appreciation of this lovely Island. Exact meanings are impossible to establish. but the sense of awe at the beauty which surrounds us and is felt by Christians and non-Christians alike, is unmissable.<p>

 No Mr Marshall visit them again and look more closely at their individuality and their strength and then let that imagination stretch luxuriously. We will not be disappointed. We and other onlookers have exciting and stimulating times ahead. A map of pedestrian links between the stones is already in preparation, and I will be delighted to send him a copy when it is published next year!<p>
